Preparation
Start the base image and install the required software. We will require the following packages:

openssh-server,
openssh-client,
wireshark,
apache2,
curl.
Run sudo apt update to update the package list from repositories. Then install the required software with sudo apt install <list-the-packages>. Note that while installing the wireshark, when asked Should non-superusers be able to capture packets? select yes. (If you make a mistake and select no, you can change your selection by running sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common.) Then add your user to the group wireshark with the following command: sudo usermod -a -G wireshark $USER. Shutdown the virtual machine.

Clone the base image twice (use linked clone and regenerate the MAC address) and name the new machines ssh-server and ssh-client.

Configure both machines to use a single network interface card (NIC): Disable (if they are not already disabled) Adapter 2, Adapter 3 and Adapter 4 in Machine > Settings > Network, and make sure that Adapter 1 is enabled. You may put both machines either on Bridged or in the same NAT network.

Assert that machines can ping each other.

Machine ssh-server
As part of the set-up, let's first change the hostname of this machine to ssh-server. (This is not related to SSH, but it will help us to know more easily which machine we are using when working in the terminal.)

First, open file /etc/hosts and add the following line: 127.0.1.1 ssh-server. Save the file. Next, run sudo hostnamectl set-hostname ssh-server. To apply the changes, restart the terminal. Observe that now each line in the terminal starts with isp@ssh-server.

Now, let's regenerate the SSH server keys for this machine. Make sure you provide an empty passphrase when asked. (Can you think of a problem that could occur, if you provide a passphrase?). Name the keys according to HostKey directive in /etc/ssh/sshd_config file. (Note, generally you'd need only a single key -- I recommend using Ed25519 -- but let's demonstrate the use of various keys.)

sudo ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
sudo ssh-keygen -t rsa   -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
sudo ssh-keygen -t dsa   -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
sudo ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
Assignments
I'll assume that the IP of the ssh-client is $CLIENT and the IP of the ssh-server is $SERVER. When running the commands below, substitute the the variable names with appropriate values.

Username/Password client authentication, server authentication
On ssh-client, use the terminal to connect to the server: ssh isp@$SERVER
Since you are connecting for the first time, you have to authenticate the server's public key. Does the public-key fingerprint match the actual fingerprint on the remote machine? To check the fingerprint, go to the next step.
To find out the server's public key fingerprint, switch to the ssh-server machine. The fingerprint depends on the type of the key that the server is using. Issue one of the following commands on the server to see the public key fingerprint. (Note that this is something you'd usually do before you'd connect to the server for the first time.)
For ECDSA key: ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub
For ED25519 key: ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub
For RSA key: ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
For DSA key: ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub
Question 1. Switch back to the ssh-client and make sure that the displayed fingerprint is correct. Obviously, the authentication should fail if fingerprints mismatch. If that were the case, what kind of an attack could be taking place?
Switch to ssh-client and input yes, if the displayed fingerprint matches the actual one. Finally, provide the password (ssh-client) and you should be logged in. Observe how the terminal input line changed from isp@isp to isp@ssh-server when you connected: this let's you know that your terminal is now connected to the ssh-server. Log-out by either inputting exit, logout, or by pressing ctrl+d.
Now let's change the SSH keypairs on the ssh-server:
sudo ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
sudo ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
sudo ssh-keygen -t dsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
sudo ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
On ssh-client, reconnect to the ssh-server. You should get an flashy warning. What does it mean?
On ssh-client, remove the saved fingerprints from ~/.ssh/known_hosts by running the command that the SSH client suggests and reconnect to the server.
Did you remember to authenticate the server's fingerprint or you simply input yes when asked?

Authenticating the client with its public key
On ssh-client, regenerate user's ssh-client SSH keys. Note that sice we are generating client SSH keys, which are stored inside user ssh-client home folder (~/.ssh and not in /etc/ssh directory), you should run the following commands as a normal user (not with sudo):
ssh-keygen -t rsa
ssh-keygen -t dsa
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa
On ssh-client, connect onto ssh-server and try to authenticate yourself your public key. Note that if the server asks for your password, the public-key login failed and the server failed-over to plain username-password authentication: ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa isp@$SERVER. (As a useful debugging note, running all ssh commands with -v switch turns on the verbose mode which prints out useful information.)
To enable public key authentication, you have to (1) copy your public key to the remote computer and then (2) enable and link it to specific account. Both actions can be done with ssh-copy-id which copies public key to the chosen account and adds public key to authorized keys list. Simply run: ssh-copy-id isp@$SERVER.
Once the key has been copied and added to the authorized_keys list, try connecting and authenticating using only public keys: ssh $SERVER. You should now login to server without providing password. (We can even omit the username, since the username on the server and on the client are the same.)
Finally, let's disable password-based login attempts and always require client authentication with public keys. On the ssh-server, open file /etc/ssh/sshd_config and add command PasswordAuthentication no. Save the file and restart the SSH server with sudo service ssh restart.

Because we have already copied our public key to the server, our client will by default try to authenticate itself with the public key. So we have to explicitly state that we want to authenticate with the username/password pair, if we want to test the most recent change. Run the following on ssh-client: ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=password -o PubkeyAuthentication=no $SERVER. If you configured the sever correctly, the connection attempt should be rejected.

Tunneling with SSH
Imagine that you'd like to access a service on a remote machine, but that service is configured to allow localhost connections only. To alleviate such limitations, we can use SSH to create a tunnel between our machine and the machine running the service and then access the service as if it was running on our machine.

The SSH will instantiate a local network socket that will forward all traffic to the service socket on the remote machine. To the service on the remote machine, the tunnel will be completely transparent: all requests that are sent through the tunnel will appear to the service as normal requests originating from localhost.

To make this example more concrete, let's configure the Apache webserver on the ssh-server to allow localhost connections only. Open file /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf and add the following snippet that limits the access to the Apache served pages:

<Directory /var/www/html>
    Require ip 127.0.0.1/8
</Directory>
Reload the Apache configuration file with sudo service apache2 reload.

If you access the apache on the server, the access should be granted. Try by running curl localhost.

If you do the same on the ssh-client (you have to replace localhost with ip of the server), you should get an HTML page saying that the access is not allowed.

Now, let's circumvent this access control by accessing the Apache server from the ssh-client with the help of a SSH tunnel.

On ssh-client, set up a tunnel by issuing ssh -L 127.0.0.1:8080:127.0.0.1:80 -N $SERVER

The -L switch denotes local port-forwarding and the -N prevents executing remote commands; this is useful for only setting up forwarded ports and not actually running terminal on the remote machine.

After you have run the command, open a new terminal (the current one is ssh'd to the server), and run curl localhost:8080. (Alternatively, open Firefox in Private browsing (ctrl+shift+p) mode and navigate to http://localhost:8080; private browsing mode is needed to disable caching, which may interfere with testing.) You are now able to access the Apache2 on the server machine, as if you were physically on the server machine. The only catch is that you have to explicitly specify the tunneled port number.

Question 2. Open another terminal on the ssh-server and observe Apache access log as you request pages on the isp machine with curl localhost:8080. You can see the real-time access log by running tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log.

What is the IP address of the client that is issuing the HTTP requests? Why? (Press ctrl+c to exit the tail program.)

Reverse SSH Tunneling
A reverse SSH tunnel is similar to a normal SSH tunnel, the difference is in the agent that initiates the tunnel. In a reverse SSH tunnel, the machine that provides the service is also the machine that sets up the tunnel. (Contrary to the local port-forwarding where the tunnel was set up by the machine that consumed the provided service.)

Using SSH, the computer that provides the service can establish a remote channel that forwards a given port on the service-providing machine to a local port on the service-consuming machine.

Again, to make the example more concrete, let's configure the ssh-server machine to use a firewall that blocks all traffic except outgoing SSH connections. As before, we'll have to disable IPv6. To disable IPv6, open file /etc/sysctl.conf and add the following lines at the end of the file:
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1
Activate changes by running sudo sysctl -p. The terminal should output the lines you added in the previous step. You should run this command each time you start up the image; IPv6 turns on by default at start.

Next, you may reuse the iptables script from the previous week's lab session. Modify the script to contain the following entries:

iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT  -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT  -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
Additionally, remove the Apache access control that we added in the previous assignment by commenting out (or deleting) the following lines in /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf:

<Directory /var/www/html>
    Require ip 127.0.0.1/8
</Directory>
Remember to reload the configuration once you have changed the file: sudo service apache2 reload.

At this point, you should be able to curl localhost on the ssh-server machine, while a curl $SERVER run on the ssh-client should fail. Moreover, you should also be unable to ssh into server from ssh-client; the firewall should block both HTTP and SSH access from the outside.

Now, the ssh-server machine is allowed to connect onto ssh-client and establish a reverse tunnel that will allow ssh-client to access the Apache pages on ssh-server. On the ssh-server, run the following:

ssh -R 127.0.0.1:8080:127.0.0.1:80 -N isp@$CLIENT

With the reverse tunnel set up, you should be able to curl localhost:8080 on the ssh-client and access the contents of the Apache server pages on the ssh-server machine.

Assignments
Use wireshark to see the messages that get exchanged during the communication set up. (If you are unable to see network interfaces when you run wireshark, you most likely did not configure it properly. You can either go through the configuration part (described at the beginning) again or run wireshark with sudo.)
Explore programs scp and rsync. A common usecase for SSH is to transfer files between machines. Learn about the following commands and use them to copy files between ssh-client and ssh-server:
scp -- secure copy (remote file copy program)
rsync -- a fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool
I'll help format this document in clear markdown while preserving all the information.



# SSH Lab Guide

## Preparation

Start the base image and install the required software. We will require the following packages:
- openssh-server
- openssh-client
- wireshark
- apache2
- curl

Update the package list and install required software:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server openssh-client wireshark apache2 curl
```

*Note: While installing wireshark, when asked "Should non-superusers be able to capture packets?" select yes. If you select no by mistake, you can change your selection by running:*
```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
```

Add your user to the wireshark group:
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G wireshark $USER
```

Shutdown the virtual machine and clone the base image twice (use linked clone and regenerate the MAC address). Name the new machines `ssh-server` and `ssh-client`.

### Network Configuration
- Configure both machines to use a single network interface card (NIC)
- Disable Adapter 2, Adapter 3 and Adapter 4 in Machine > Settings > Network
- Ensure Adapter 1 is enabled
- Place both machines either on Bridged or in the same NAT network
- Verify machines can ping each other

## Machine ssh-server Setup

### Change Hostname
1. Open `/etc/hosts` and add:
```
127.0.1.1 ssh-server
```
2. Run:
```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname ssh-server
```
3. Restart the terminal. Lines should now start with `isp@ssh-server`

### Regenerate SSH Server Keys
*Note: Provide an empty passphrase when asked*

```bash
sudo ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
sudo ssh-keygen -t rsa   -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
sudo ssh-keygen -t dsa   -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
sudo ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
```

## Assignments

*Assume `$CLIENT` is the IP of ssh-client and `$SERVER` is the IP of ssh-server*

### 1. Username/Password Client Authentication, Server Authentication

1. On ssh-client, connect to server:
```bash
ssh isp@$SERVER
```

2. To verify server's public key fingerprint on ssh-server, use:
```bash
# For ECDSA key
ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub
# For ED25519 key
ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub
# For RSA key
ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
# For DSA key
ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub
```

**Question 1**: Verify the displayed fingerprint is correct. What kind of attack could be taking place if fingerprints mismatch?

3. Change SSH keypairs on ssh-server:
```bash
sudo ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
sudo ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
sudo ssh-keygen -t dsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
sudo ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
```

### 2. Client Public Key Authentication

On ssh-client, generate SSH keys:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
ssh-keygen -t dsa
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa
```

Connect using public key:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa isp@$SERVER
```

Copy public key to server:
```bash
ssh-copy-id isp@$SERVER
```

Disable password authentication on ssh-server:
1. Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
```
PasswordAuthentication no
```
2. Restart SSH service:
```bash
sudo service ssh restart
```

Test password authentication is disabled:
```bash
ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=password -o PubkeyAuthentication=no $SERVER
```

### 3. Tunneling with SSH

Configure Apache on ssh-server for localhost only:
1. Edit `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf`:
```apache
<Directory /var/www/html>
    Require ip 127.0.0.1/8
</Directory>
```
2. Reload Apache:
```bash
sudo service apache2 reload
```

Create SSH tunnel:
```bash
ssh -L 127.0.0.1:8080:127.0.0.1:80 -N $SERVER
```

**Question 2**: Observe Apache access log:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log
```

### 4. Reverse SSH Tunneling

Configure IPv6 and firewall on ssh-server:

1. Add to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:
```
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1
```

2. Apply changes:
```bash
sudo sysctl -p
```

3. Configure iptables:
```bash
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT  -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT  -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
```

Create reverse tunnel:
```bash
ssh -R 127.0.0.1:8080:127.0.0.1:80 -N isp@$CLIENT
```

## Additional Tasks

1. Use Wireshark to observe message exchange during communication setup

2. Explore file transfer commands:
- `scp` - secure copy (remote file copy program)
- `rsync` - fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool
